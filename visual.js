The flight of birds, with their remarkable structure and instinct, inspires humanity to create a way to navigate the skies, leading to the creation of planes. The glowing light around the plane cradled in the lady’s hand symbolizes the spark of creativity drawn from nature’s wisdom. The lady herself represents the creative minds driven by the desire to transform inspiration into invention. Her nurturing hold on the plane reflects the drive to innovate while honoring the natural world that guides us. This artwork invites the viewers to look at inventions around us and ask the question: What in nature inspired this? By making this connection, it urges us to see nature not just as a resource but also as a teacher deserving of respect and admiration.",

On one hand, it provides a hopeful vision of what the world could be—perhaps even inspiring a desire to restore nature.

As I considered how to approach this project, I came across a photo I took during my visit to Vietnam in 2023. Among the numerous breathtaking places I visited there, Halong Bay remains the most memorable place to me. The calm beauty of the limestone karsts rising from the emerald waters left a lasting mark on me. More importantly, the joyful moments I shared together with my family during that trip make this place more meaningful to me.<br>Nonetheless, this artwork is more than just a sentimental digital art piece for me; the painting's water flows convey a deeper message about how science profoundly impacts not only society but also other facets of life. The flowing water symbolizes the growth, expansion, versatility, and wide-ranging influence of science. Just as water alters the landscapes and places it touches, science continuously also transforms the world—pushing boundaries and enabling development. In line with this, this transformation can influence human creativity and artistic expression, so it also extends beyond the physical. This digital watercolor technique is an immediate product of the confluence of science and art, imaging how these two disciplines intertwine to showcase one’s creativity. Similar to how water represents life and sustenance, scientific advancements \"flow\" through societies, influencing not only infrastructure, technology, and culture but also how we use art to tell stories and convey our feelings. Halong Bay, with its timeless natural beauty, serves as a perfect subject to convey these ideas. The painting's dynamic flow of waters symbolizes both the deep connection between creativity, nature, and humanity, as well as the never-ending flow of innovation and discoveries in science and the arts. In this piece, I aim to show that art and science are not isolated fields. They can be interdependent forces that support and encourage one another to deepen our understanding of the world and our role in it.",

        "description": "Taking inspiration from Chris Sanders’ animated film, “The Wild Robot,” my art piece illuminates a robot pondering an unfamiliar peculiarity. In Sanders’ film, Roz, a service robot stranded on a human-less island, finds itself calling nature its home after accidentally decapitating the mother of a chick named Brightbill. Compelled to fulfill its duty as a service robot, Roz acted beyond its known programming in order to parent Brightbill, overcoming challenges along the way as it was never in its code to care for a wild animal.<br><br>My piece, titled Curiosity Saves the Robot, plays on the phrase, “curiosity kills the cat.” It emphasizes on how a fledgeling saves the robot a life of repetitiveness—allowing it to take the first step outside its machine cycle, i.e. fetching, decoding, and executing known programs. This act of curiosity illustrates how the unknown can lead to unimaginable outcomes and how venturing upon it can unlock a world of discovery and wonder.",
