The flight of birds, with their remarkable structure and instinct, inspires humanity to create a way to navigate the skies, leading to the creation of planes. The glowing light around the plane cradled in the lady’s hand symbolizes the spark of creativity drawn from nature’s wisdom. The lady herself represents the creative minds driven by the desire to transform inspiration into invention. Her nurturing hold on the plane reflects the drive to innovate while honoring the natural world that guides us. This artwork invites the viewers to look at inventions around us and ask the question: What in nature inspired this? By making this connection, it urges us to see nature not just as a resource but also as a teacher deserving of respect and admiration.",

Inspired by the movie “The Wild Robot (2024)”, the artwork presents a gentle robot who has discovered a new purpose far from its original program—not in serving humanity, but in nurturing the very nature that has reclaimed our world. This mechanical being has grown beyond its directives—finding family in a loyal dog, making friends with curious geese, and earning the trust of colorful birds who now perch freely upon its metal frame.<br>The bright yellow house symbolizes the robot's newfound home in this new yet familiar world; its well-maintained appearance amidst the wild landscape represents how our mechanical friend has found its way to create order and meaning in nature. The weathered dock with its wooden barrels and the simple well are not just intended for design but instead are signs of a carefully tended home. In the background, the ruins of our once-towering cities serve not as monuments to loss but as gardens for new life. Where nature can demonstrate its incredible power to heal and transform what was once broken with time.<br>This artwork integrates science and art by visualizing what could be considered as the relationship between artificial intelligence and natural life. Through this piece, I wanted to express how technology, despite its artificial origins, holds the potential to become a guardian of nature rather than its opponent and that even in a world where human civilization has faded, the best of what we created might live on to protect and nurture the world we left behind and perhaps even hope to make amends for the destruction we have caused in our species’ lifetime.",

The inside of the phone depicts a hopeful, idealized world—a virtual and fragile vision—starkly contrasted against the surrounding degradation and loss.<br>In particular, the phone represents a double-edged sword—held out in front of what remains of the world—displaying a VR escape where its owner uses the allure of technology to avoid facing the harsh reality of environmental destruction. On one hand, it provides a hopeful vision of what the world could be—perhaps even inspiring a desire to restore nature. On the other hand, it suggests humanity’s increasing reliance on virtual realities to escape the consequences of environmental neglect, rather than confronting and solving real-world problems. The inclusion of bees symbolizes nature’s delicate balance, emphasizing their role as pollinators, crucial to the world’s ecosystems and food production which serves as an indicator of environmental health.<br>This piece serves as a reminder that art is not merely an aesthetic endeavor but a powerful way to communicate and amplify scientific truths, inspiring society to confront and act on ecological challenges.",

No matter the distance, no matter how bounded. The crater is unfortunate to be alone in a moon, in a moon out of reach, nor be seen until you came here to see an image of it. What I am trying to show is multifaceted; one is a hunger for people to reach one another, no matter how vain. The other, say, is to be fully understood, even if we know—even the crater knows—that it is impossible. We can only see an image of the crater, not the real holistic  thing; merely a perspective, a part.<br>I was inspired to make this out of an experience with a friend. They cut off from the friend group once. It is because they felt alone in this university, that they are homesick. I believe that they are trying to not feel alone here, but they just cannot. So, they cut us off because they are disappointed, or is it a means to manipulate us friends to garner attention? Either way, it is similar to the crater—a restrained, unmoving hole desperate to find others in the dark side of the moon; the moon that too which is alone.",

        "description": "This visual artwork is a digital painting that combines various digital watercolor elements featuring graphic elements that depict the famous Vịnh Hạ Long, or Halong Bay, in Vietnam. As I considered how to approach this project, I came across a photo I took during my visit to Vietnam in 2023. Among the numerous breathtaking places I visited there, Halong Bay remains the most memorable place to me. The calm beauty of the limestone karsts rising from the emerald waters left a lasting mark on me. More importantly, the joyful moments I shared together with my family during that trip make this place more meaningful to me.<br>Nonetheless, this artwork is more than just a sentimental digital art piece for me; the painting's water flows convey a deeper message about how science profoundly impacts not only society but also other facets of life. The flowing water symbolizes the growth, expansion, versatility, and wide-ranging influence of science. Just as water alters the landscapes and places it touches, science continuously also transforms the world—pushing boundaries and enabling development. In line with this, this transformation can influence human creativity and artistic expression, so it also extends beyond the physical. This digital watercolor technique is an immediate product of the confluence of science and art, imaging how these two disciplines intertwine to showcase one’s creativity. Similar to how water represents life and sustenance, scientific advancements \"flow\" through societies, influencing not only infrastructure, technology, and culture but also how we use art to tell stories and convey our feelings. Halong Bay, with its timeless natural beauty, serves as a perfect subject to convey these ideas. The painting's dynamic flow of waters symbolizes both the deep connection between creativity, nature, and humanity, as well as the never-ending flow of innovation and discoveries in science and the arts. In this piece, I aim to show that art and science are not isolated fields. They can be interdependent forces that support and encourage one another to deepen our understanding of the world and our role in it.",
