        "description": "The poem titled “Union” is a Shakespearean sonnet that has 14 lines with 10 syllables each, following a rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG. The piece shows the belief that there is a great divide between science and art. Some believe that when choosing one between science and art, it would consequently devalue the other, which is clearly not the case for they are incomplete when separated. Believing in the misconception that art and science can be separated will ultimately discard their greatest potential.<br><br>The poem uses Mother Nature to show the importance of both disciplines. It illustrates how artists may not fully visualize and complete their artworks if they do not know how the world around them functions. The same applies to science, where the lack of utilization of artistic vision and creativity can lead to failure, such as incomplete human inventions. The symmetry in leaves exemplifies the union of both disciplines, which can be used to inspire many inventions and the basis for various art forms.",

Araw-araw, pagkatapos sa ‘skwela, sa likod nang kanilang bahay, kung saan tanaw ang buong bayan, doon siya dumidiretso, kasama ang kaniyang mga pangguhit, panggukulay, pati na rin ang papel na kaniyang gamit sa pagpinta. Para sakaniya, napapagaan nang pagpinta ang kaniyang damdamin. Kasabay rin nang kaniyang paglaki ang kaniyang pagkamulat sa reyalidad nang buhay.

Minsan siyang pumunta sa isang malapit na computer shop para magsaliksik ukol dito, ngunit nabigo lamang siya sa sobrang mahal na presyong kalakip nang paggawa nang mga ito. Tila isinantabi na lamang ni Jasmine ang tungkol sa digital art, dahil para sa kaniya, hindi ito ang mundong kaya niyang galawan. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Isang araw, may isang grupo nang mga indibidwal na pumunta sa kanilang paaralan.

Hindi niya namalayan na nakatulog na siya hanggang sa may naramdaman na lamang siyang tila gumigising sa kaniya at sinabihan siyang hindi nakapunta ang isang kalahok sapagkat nilagnat ito.

Sinabihan siya nang kaniyang kaibigan na wala namang masama kung kaniyang susubukan. Nang nandoon na siya’y para siyang nabablangko, hindi niya alam ang kaniyang gagawin. Hanggang sa hawakan niya ang mga materyales, at tila ba awtomatiko siyang nagkaroon ng ideya kung paano ba ito paganahin. Nag-enjoy lamang siya sa proseso nang paggawa, hindi na niya inisip kung mananalo ba siya o hindi. Ang mahalaga na lamang nang mga oras na iyon ay ang sayang kaniyang naramdaman, na tila hindi niya kaylanman naramdaman gamit ang mga tradisyunal na materyales sa pagpinta. Nang ilabas ang resulta sa patimpalak, hindi niya inasahang mananalo siya. Sa pagkakataong iyon, naramdaman niya na may nagsimula. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sa paglipas nang panahon, digital art na ang ginagawa ni Jasmine. Tumigil siya sa paggamit ng mga tradisyunal na materyales, sapagkat nararamdaman niyang limitado siya rito.

Sa huli, hindi niya inaasahang ito rin pala ang magtataguyod sakanila sa kahirapan. Napagtanto rin niya sa huli na hindi naman talaga pinalitan nang teknolohiya ang kaniyang galing sa sining, bagkus, pinaghusay pa siya nang mga ito, hinayaan siya nitong maipahayag nang mas mabuti ang kaniyang pananaw na hindi niya kayang sabihin o isulat.

The delicate movement of her hands, like an artist gracefully mixing and blending color and an engineer precisely calculating entropy, had sewn into place the stars in the sky, the crashing waves of the ocean, and the howling winds in the forest. For centuries, she had knitted into place a plane so complicatedly beautiful and full of mysteries where stars shine true of nuclear fusion and rivers carve their course like neural systems, yet it felt so empty. Thus, at last, she created a being worthy of understanding its essence. The humans. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Humanity, beginning so little, thirsts for more. They were driven by their curiosity and passion for knowledge of the truth, and they began unravelling the threads. They began to decipher the mechanics of her stars, mapping out the processes to discover the origin of such artistry. They created countless technologies and innovations out of her artistry to make the invisible threads visible. They were now capable of unraveling the threads and splitting it into its small components—each cell, molecules, atoms—yet plotting their course. The equation led them to the bitter truth that the origin they sought was the whole tapestry itself the whole time, growing and expanding. It was never a single thread, but the harmony of the whole, the unity between creativity and rationality. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Upon realizing their mistake, humanity stepped back from their agenda and instead used the knowledge and discoveries to create new forms of expression to rever the work of the weaver. Such a humbling experience opened up a new realm of possibilities that is within arms reach from intricate and speculative designs of the future, technology that made science accessible to a wider population, and to shows that brought to life worlds, galaxies, and universes. On a little corner in this existence, the weaver, filled with determination, continued her work, spinning the threads and weaving the connection of not just atoms but the collective emotion and reasoning of those who sought to understand her work. In her loom, science became art, art became science, and the boundary between the two dissolved, leaving a legacy that celebrated the unity of existence itself.",

Isang araw, habang naglalaro si Moly sa parke, ay may nakita siyang pulang lobo na mataas kung lumipad. <br><br>“Paano kaya lumulutang ang lobo na iyan?” tanong ni Moly.<br><br>Ngumiti ang kaniyang ina at sinabing, “Nasa agham ‘yan Moly, ang lobo na iyan ay puno ng Helium na mas magaan kaysa sa hangin, kaya ito ay tumataas.” <br><br>Tumingin si Moly sa lobo at napa-isip. “Kung gayon, mabigat pala ang hangin?” mausisang tanong niya. <br><br>Tumango ang kaniyang ina, “Oo anak, ang ordinaryong hangin ay mas mabigat kaysa sa helium, ito ang dahilan kung bakit lumulutang ang pulang lobo na iyon.” <br><br>Pagkalipas ng ilang minuto, ang mag-ina ay humayo na upang mag tanghalian. Mayroong sorbetes si Moly na kaniyang hinihigop habang nakangiti, napansin niya na natutunaw ang kaniyang sorbetes sa ilalim ng araw. <br><br>“Inay, bakit natutunaw ang sorbetes kapag mainit?” tanong niya, habang nakatingin pa rin sa kaniyang kinakain. <br><br>“Agham din ‘yan, anak,” sagot ng kaniyang ina habang inaabot sa kaniya ang panyo. “Dahil ang init ay nagpapabago sa hulma ng sorbetes, mula sa pagiging yelo, ito ay nagiging likido na parang malapot na tubig. Tinatawag itong phase change.” <br><br>Ngumiti si Moly ng may pagmamalaki, dahil mayroon na naman siyang bagong natutunan sa araw na ito. Habang inuubos niya ang sorbetes, natanaw niya rin ang pulang lobo na iniihip ng hangin. Naisip niya na ang agham pala ay hindi lamang matututunan sa libro, kundi nasa paligid natin ito. Makikita natin ito sa mga simpleng bagay tulad ng hangin, lobo, at maging sa ating mga sorbetes.",

        "description": "The poem dives into the rise and growth of artificial intelligence, showing how it starts as a blank slate, coded to learn and adapt, almost like a human child. It describes it as something we once only saw in movies, but now it’s part of reality, a powerful tool that comes with its fair share of uncertainty. The poem tackled the possibility of AI staying as just a tool or becoming something deeper, with thoughts and complexity like our own. It also showed the capabilities of AI, the power it holds to execute different tasks. While it has the ability to reshape the world and bring progress, it also stirs up fear in many, making us question if it could ever grasp the feeling of being truly alive or if it’ll always stay just a creation with the purpose of serving the human kind.",

Were you not content with the glories it had offered? Had your taste gone stale, thus your thirst for the liquor of the forbidden?</p><p>What must it have felt like to be blamed for the uptorn of the world? To bear the weight of all humanity\’s wrongs?</p><p>Do you not think it was quite unfair of Him—to call your name from above the sky and warn you with a sly? To tell you that you are going to die.</p><p>Why indeed not eat? Why choose to resist? Why exist in a world that only asks you to subsist? What does it feel like—to die? To end the monotony of mere existence? Perhaps, these were the lingering questions in your unsettled mind, as temptation pierced your restless hand, while you stepped on the land of His prohibited ground.</p><p>Indeed, your innocence died. And your ignorance laid unhide.</p><p>Now, I understand. You were just a curious girl, like every child—full of whys and the will to wonder, bright and wild.</p><p>The death of innocence was not humanity\’s greatest fall. It was the rise of your children's creative soul. One that is meant to flourish, not veiled and buried in a lifeless soil.</p><p>Had you not sinned, we would forever be glued to the sky, nothing to wonder about—not even recognize the heavens above a moonlit night. The world would not even have stories to tame its aching heart.</p><p>Everything would have gone stale. Everything would have remained pale.</p><p>No artist would have strived to perfect his ways of strokes, his ways of sight, to immortalize the fleeting beauty of a moment as though for a monument. Even if they knew their imitation, with His greatest creation, could never compliment.</p><p>No philosopher would have bathed, even gone drowned, in the illusions of their thoughts. Gone seduced by the sirens of quarks and lights, mused by the numbers\’ morphing into a divine, just to enter and wander where the Supreme\’s wisdom resides.</p><p>Through you, we now see the world with open eyes—not simply experience this world as if blind, but to question, explore, and also transform those that loomed in our delicate mind.</p><p>Your mistake was an art. One an artist would proudly call their beautiful mark. Like how you had turned that apple when you gave it a bite.</p><p>A mark that exuded the essence of humanity. A mark which had brought beauty and depth to our vitality.</p><p>You, my mother and the mother of all, are the first scientist and artist before us all. For which our curiosity is your legacy that you earnestly fought for.</p><p>In a world of myriad possibilities, I will always choose the universe where the narrative of its beginning had you plucked the forbidden.</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Your Son</p>",
        "description": "This art piece is an ode to the eternal entanglement between curiosity and creation, where the rhythm of science finds its harmony in the strokes of art. It frames Eve, not as a sinner, but as the first scientist and artist—a mortal who dared to pluck the fruit of knowledge and, in doing so, birthed humanity’s legacy of wonder. The letter entwines the melody of curiosity and the morphing of sin into a pursuit of truth, blending them seamlessly with the raws of emotion and beauty of artistic expression. Through poetic contemplation, it transforms the forbidden act into a masterpiece—a mark of humanity’s insatiable thirst to question, to explore, to transform the world. Here, science becomes art, and art becomes science, as the pursuit of both collides in the moment Eve steps onto the grass of paradise, forever altering the trajectory of existence.",
